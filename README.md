UWaterloo ECE Fourth Year Design Project - SMAC'M (Shadi, Maya, Aurchon, Caleb, Marley)

This social cooking app offers a solution for busy families, groups of friends, or anyone looking to streamline their meal preparation process.

Kitchen Buddies optimizes the cooking workflow, enabling multiple people to cook multiple recipes in parallel. It facilitates coordination and structure in the process of meal preparation, ensuring all recipes are ready at the same time - this allows all freshly cooked dishes to be enjoyed hot and fresh!

We created this app to bring people together in the kitchen and make mealtime a more enjoyable and efficient experience. Although the backend is not being hosted anymore after, feel free to check out a short demo video here: https://youtu.be/wGmMyfTvzW0
