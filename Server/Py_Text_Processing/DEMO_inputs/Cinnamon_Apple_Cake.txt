Cinnamon Apple Cake
Total Time: 65

Ingredients: 
210 grams (1 and 1/2 cups) plain flour or all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
150 grams (3/4 cup) caster sugar or granulated sugar
1 cup (approximately 1 large) red apple, peeled and roughly chopped
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
120 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable oil
120 ml (1/2 cup) Greek yogurt
50 grams (1/4 cup) caster sugar or granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter, melted
30 grams (1/4 cup) icing sugar or powdered sugar, sifted
1-2 tablespoons milk

Instructions: 
Preheat oven to 180 C (350 F) standard / 160 C (320 F) fan-forced. Grease and line an 8-inch round cake pan with baking or parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. Add chopped apple and stir briefly to combine.
In a separate bowl, add eggs, vanilla, oil and yogurt. Whisk briefly just to break up the egg yolks.
Add wet ingredients into bowl with flour and gently mix with a wooden spoon until combined – but be careful not to over mix. Spoon batter into prepared tin.
To make cinnamon topping, combine cinnamon, sugar and butter in bowl. Mix together until lumpy and wet. Sprinkle over cake batter in pan.
Bake cake for approximately 30-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Transfer cake to a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the glaze, mix together sugar and 1 tablespoon of milk in bowl. Stir until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, add an extra tablespoon of milk. Drizzle glaze all over the cake.
