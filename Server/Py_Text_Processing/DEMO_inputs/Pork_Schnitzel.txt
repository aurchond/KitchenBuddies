Pork Schnitzel
Total Time: 45

Ingredients: 
10  pork cutlets
1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1 teaspoon pepper (or to taste)
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 large eggs (or more if needed)
2 cups breadcrumbs (regular or Panko)
vegetable oil (for frying)

Instructions: 
Using the flat end of a meat tenderizer, pound the pork working from the center out until the each cutlet is ¼ inch thick. Season cutlet with salt and pepper.
Place flour in a bowl. In another bowl, beat eggs. In another bowl, add breadcrumbs. Season the bowls of flour, eggs and breadcrumbs with salt and pepper. 
Dredge each cutlet through flour on both sides, next through the beaten eggs and finally through the breadcrumbs. Place them on a large plate and repeat with remaining cutlets.
Fill a large skillet with about ½ teaspoon of oil over medium-high heat and heat it until it&#039;s 350°F. Fry the cutlets for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they're a nice deep golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate and repeat with remaining schnitzel. You might have to change the oil halfway through if it gets too dirty.
Serve with lemon wedges and mustard over mashed potatoes.
