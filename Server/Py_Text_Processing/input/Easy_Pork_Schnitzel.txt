Easy Pork Schnitzel
Total Time: 0

Ingredients: 
6 Ontario boneless pork loin center chops, about 1-inch thick
Salt and fresh cracked black pepper
1½ cups (343 ml) panko bread crumbs
2 tsp (30 ml) Italian seasoning
½ cup (118 ml) all-purpose flour
2 large eggs
Canola oil, for frying
6 ciabatta buns or brioche burger buns (optional)
Horseradish mustard or Dijon mustard

Instructions: 
On a cutting board, using a very sharp knife, butterfly the pork chops; making sure not to cut all the way through. Open chops and place between two pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until  between 1/16 to 1/4-inch thick (depending on your preference). Season both sides of chops with salt and pepper.
In a shallow bowl whisk together panko and Italian seasoning. In another shallow bowl pour flour. In the last shallow bowl beat eggs. 
Place a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet. One at a time dredge both sides of the pork chop in flour then dip into egg mixture, letting any excess drip off before placing in panko. Make sure both sides are completely covered in bread crumbs before placing breaded chop on wire rack. Repeat process with remaining chops.
To a large skillet, add enough oil to sufficiently cover the bottom of the pan. Heat over medium-high. Once oil is hot, add breaded chops; working in batches of 2-3. Cook 3-4 minutes per side, or until chop is golden brown and crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Immediately season with salt. 
Serve over mashed potatoes topped with sauerkraut, mustard, and a side of corn.
