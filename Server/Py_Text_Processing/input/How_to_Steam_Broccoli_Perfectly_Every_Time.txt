How to Steam Broccoli Perfectly Every Time
Total Time: 15

Ingredients: 
1 bunch of broccoli
Many options here:
Olive oil, butter, or mayonnaise (use olive oil if cooking vegan)
Freshly ground black pepper
Lemon zest or juice, balsamic vinegar, seasoned rice vinegar
Toasted almonds, toasted sesame seeds

Instructions: 
Prep the broccoli crowns and stems: Cut the crowns away from the large stems of the broccoli. Break the crown up into bite-sized florets. Rinse the broccoli florets thoroughly. Peel and discard the thick outer skin of the stems. Slice the stems or cut them into quarters lengthwise.
Bring steamer water to a boil: Place 3/4 to 1 inch of water in a saucepan with a steamer and bring to a boil. (Note that if you don&#39;t have a steamer, you can simply put the broccoli directly into an inch of boiling water.)
Add broccoli, steam 5 to 6 min: Add the broccoli to the steamer and cover; reduce heat to medium and let cook for 5-6 minutes. The broccoli is done when you can pierce it with a fork. As soon as it is pierce-able, remove from heat, place in serving dish. Note that green vegetables like broccoli will turn from vibrant green to drab olive green at about the 7 minute mark of cooking. So, watch the time, and don&#39;t let the broccoli overcook!
Dress with your favorite topping: Dress to taste with butter, olive oil, mayonnaise, lemon zest or juice, seasoned rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, ground black pepper, toasted almonds, or sesame seeds.
