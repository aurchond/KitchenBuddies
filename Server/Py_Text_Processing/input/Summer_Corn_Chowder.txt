Summer Corn Chowder
Total Time: 50

Ingredients: 
8  ears fresh sweet yellow corn, (husked and silks removed and kernels cut from cob)
3 Tbsp butter
5 slices bacon, (cut into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces (see note*))
1 medium yellow onion chopped ((1 1/2 cups))
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 clove garlic, (minced)
5 cups water (or low-sodium chicken broth)
1 lb Yukon Gold potatoes, (cut into 1/2-inch pieces)
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1  bay leaf
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup half and half
1 Tbsp honey
2 - 3 Tbsp chopped fresh chives
Shredded cheddar cheese, (for serving (optional))

Instructions: 
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and bacon and cook, stirring frequently, until onion has softened and just starting to brown around edges, about 8 - 10 minutes.
Add in the flour and garlic and cook 1 1/2 minutes. While whisking, slowly pour in 5 cups water or broth.
Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, then stir in corn kernels and potatoes. Add in thyme and bay leaf and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Bring to a light boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
Remove bay leave then transfer 2 1/2 cups of the chowder to a blender and blend until smooth.
Stir the mixture back into the pot then stir in half and half and honey. Sprinkle each serving with chives and optional cheddar.
