Sheet Pan Mini Meatloaf with Vegetables
Total Time: 50

Ingredients: 
1 lb. lean ground beef
⅓ cup BBQ sauce, divided
½ tsp. garlic powder
½ tsp. onion powder
¼ tsp. dried thyme
½ tsp. salt
1 Pinch black pepper
1 lb. Brussels sprouts, trimmed (halved if large, quartered if really large)
1 large sweet potato, cut into ½-inch pieces (peeled, if desired)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp. olive oil
Salt and pepper
Optional: fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions: 
Preheat the oven to 400℉.
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Place the sweet potato cubes,  Brussels sprouts, and minced garlic on the baking sheet. Drizzle oil over vegetables then gently toss to coat and sprinkle with salt and pepper before spreading them out so that they’re in a single layer. 
Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast the vegetables for 15 minutes. 
While the vegetables are roasting, mix the ground beef with ¼ cup BBQ sauce, garlic and onion powders, thyme, salt, and pepper. Divide the meat mixture into 4 portions and shape each into a football shape about ¾-inch thick. Set aside. 
After the vegetables have been in the oven for 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Stir vegetables then make a space between them for the meatloaves. 
Place the meatloaves on the pan and spread the remaining BBQ sauce over each one. 
Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for an additional 12-15 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meatloaves registers 165℉.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven, sprinkle with chopped parsley (if desired) and serve immediately.
