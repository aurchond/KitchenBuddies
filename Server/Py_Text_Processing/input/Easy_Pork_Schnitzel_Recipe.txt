Easy Pork Schnitzel Recipe
Total Time: 35

Ingredients: 
4  boneless pork chops
Salt &amp; pepper ((to taste))
1/4 cup flour
2  eggs ((beaten with a fork))
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
3 tablespoons olive oil  ((divided))
2 tablespoons butter ((divided))
Lemon wedges ((for serving))

Instructions: 
Prepare 3 shallow bowls (or a bowl for the egg and one plate each for the flour and panko).
Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until they&#039;re 1/4&quot; thick (or even thinner) using the flat side of a meat mallet. Season them generously with salt &amp; pepper.
Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter to a large skillet. The pan should be well coated, so add more oil if needed. Let the pan heat up for a few minutes over medium-high heat. You will be doing two batches, so for the second batch add at least one more tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and the remaining tablespoon of butter.
Coat the pork chops in flour, followed by the egg (let excess drip off), and finally the panko breadcrumbs (you may need to gently pat it down to make them stick).
Fry two schnitzels at a time for about 3 minutes/side. Easily flip them using cooking tongs. If the pan starts to smoke, turn the heat down a bit. Repeat with the next batch (add remaining oil and butter).
Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
