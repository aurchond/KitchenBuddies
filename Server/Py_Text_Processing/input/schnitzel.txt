In a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar with the sugar, thyme, and 1/4 cup of the oil; season with salt and pepper.
Put the potatoes and garlic in a pot and cover with water; season with salt and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat until the potatoes are tender, 10 minutes.
Drain and thinly slice the potatoes.
Add to the dressing and toss. Discard the garlic.
Put the flour, eggs, and panko in three separate shallow bowls. Season the pork with salt and pepper and dip in the flour.
Dip the cutlets in the egg and then in the panko.
Press to help the crumbs adhere.
In a large skillet, heat 1/2 inch of oil until shimmering. Add the cutlets in a single layer and cook over high heat, turning once.
Cook until golden and crispy, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Add the parsley to the skillet and cook, stirring, until crisp, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the parsley to a paper towel\u2013lined plate and sprinkle with salt.
Serve the pork with the potato salad. Garnish with the parsley.
