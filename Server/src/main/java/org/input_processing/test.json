I brined my 16lb bird for a day and a half, then let it dry out in the fridge until the next morning when it was time to prepare it. I took another's suggestion and made a garlic-herb butter that I rubbed inside the cavity and stuck slabs of it under the skin. Followed the recipe to the letter and it was THE juiciest turkey I've ever eaten. Everyone was amazed at how juicy and flavorful the breast meat was. Will be doing it this way every year now!

I do it a little differently though. \n\nI use all of the seasonings as written. I stuff it traditional sage dressing (bread, egg, onion, celery, and lots of sage) though, which is so yummy with the chicken broth and champagne. I also top the turkey with some of the seasonings as well. The gravy from the champagne and left over stuffing is fantastic! \n\nSeriously, so good!",

            "reviewBody": "OK so here's a funny Christmas story. I volunteered for the job of making the turkey for Christmas dinner this year. I'd never done a turkey but I wanted to learn so I stepped up. I found this recipe and away I went. Now, I did swap out the champagne for Grand Traverse Pinot Grisio, rubbed the turkey down with EV Olive Oil instead of butter, and rubbed the seasoning mixture all over the turkey not just inside it. However you may want to keep some of the seasoning to reapply after you pour the chicken broth and wine/champagne over it. She was all ready to go and she was absolutely beautiful. The over was pre-heated and I tented her with foil and put her in the oven and set the timer for 3 hours. Then I went and sat down to watch a movie. My mother and sister were making the dressing and everything while the turkey was cooking or so I thought. The timer went off and I went to take the bird out. She was cold. Turns out, when I set the timer, I somehow turned off the oven. Talk about massively disappointed! Luckily we had ham as well so my sister went ahead and finished the rest of the sides and we ate. Before we ate, I heated the oven again and in the turkey went. She got done about 11pm and then I pulled her out and rubbed butter on her and put her back in uncovered for about another 45 minutes. When I pulled her out, OH MY GOD! She was just beautiful!!!! I let her sit for another 30 minutes and then I cut some of the breast off to taste and let out a loud YES!!!",

From there I followed every direction without question. My turkey cooked for a full hour more after pulling away the foil, I had a pop-out temperature plug inserted in the turkey, decided to blindly trust it after checking the temperature with a digital reader, and boom. Perfection. The loveliest part of pouring the champagne was giving myself a glass and celebrating the beginning of the end of the struggle. This will go in my rotation forever. Kids complimented me, My friend\u2019s toddler who doesn\u2019t like turkey ate it, and the men loved the moist meat with the crispy skin. Not a dry bite in the house! I\u2019m sure there are other great recipes out there, but I chose this one because I didn\u2019t change the heat from 425 to 350, no babysitting, and I was intrigued by the champagne. So glad I did this. My guests loved the novelty of using champagne and it was a fun conversation.",

I cooked a 13.5lb turkey for 2.5 hr +30min and my breast was a little dry but the dark meat fell off the bone. The flavor is nice and herb-ey with a hint of sweetness from the oranges and champagne. I followed the instructions exactly except I added a little kosher salt onto the skin after I poured over with the broth and booze. Thank you for posting!!",
